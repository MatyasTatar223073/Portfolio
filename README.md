## Projects
Year 1
- In the third quarter of year one I created a proof-of-concept Computer Vision application for image classification using Python and Tensorflow. Our creative brief was straight-forward: Choose a classification task of your liking (Binary or Multi-class) and find data for it. Process the data and train a Multilayered Perceptron, along with a Convolutional Neural Network, and compare their performance. Create a Wireframe Prototype for an application that could interface with the chosen model.
