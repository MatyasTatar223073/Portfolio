## Projects

### Year 1
- In the third quarter of year one I created a proof-of-concept Computer Vision application for image classification using Python and Tensorflow.
- Our creative brief instructions area as follows: Choose a classification task of your liking (Binary or Multi-class) and find data for it. Process the data and train a Multilayered Perceptron, along with a Convolutional Neural Network, and compare their performance. Create a Wireframe Prototype for an application that could interface with the chosen model.
- With little awareness of the hardware requirements, I initially started with a 63-class task for classifying a wide variety of plants. Once realizing the difficulty of this task I decided to narrow the classes to daisies and sunflowers. Since they are similar in both shape and color, I was curious to see how well each algorithhm did in differentiating the species.
